# GTAD v2
### Why v2?
We abandoned to try and save every game in a separate file. It worked. For a while.
But eventually the file overhead became to big and process of analyzing and converting the 
data to slow. GTAD no longer relies on files. It basically gets the data from one database,
converts it and stores it in a second database. (our backend database) 
We already updated our [GG](https://github.com/Cerberus-ik/rr-live/tree/master/Riot-GG) and did the same
to this program.
