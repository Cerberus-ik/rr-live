# GTAD-LEGACY
### Why legacy?
We abandoned trying to save every game in a separate file. It worked. For a while.
But eventually the file overhead became to big and process of analyzing and converting the 
data to slow.

### What now?
GTAD will continue to exist but in a different way. We published a v2 of [GTAD](https://github.com/Cerberus-ik/rr-live/tree/master/Games-To-Ajax-Data)
with database support. We updated our [GG](https://github.com/Cerberus-ik/rr-live/tree/master/Riot-GG) before and ``GTAD v2`` is the last
step towards us finishing moving to databases.
